{"name":"Objects","tagline":"Organize Everything","body":"### Introduction\r\nObjects is a personal project aimed to be a system to organize the diverse types of information that we interact with everyday. From simple text, numbers, and dates to hundred-page documents and charts, I want to build an interface that can act as a hub that allows for easy access on the part of the user. While maintaining simple functionality as well as a welcoming design and user experience, I hope to create something practical and beautiful.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
